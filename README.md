- The database contains the different treatments undergoing clinical trials and the genes targeted by them, if any.
- The database contains a list of known carcinogens associated with lung cancer and information about the subject's exposure levels.
- The database includes data about companies involved in the development of the treatments undergoing clinical trials.
